## Short Description

Production forecast overview consists of production forecast, yield forecast, and harvested acreage forecast. Our forecast result is updated daily during crop season.

For north america, we gather weather data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite products and Global Historical Climatology Network Daily (GHCND) stations, while for south american, we use MODIS and Climate Prediction Center (CPC). We choose 7 parameters to make forecast, which are Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Land Surface Temperature (LST) in day and night, maximum and minimum temperature, and precipitation. 

## Roadmap
For now, we provide 
1. county, district, state and national level forecast results for corn and soybean in the United States;
2. district, province and natioal level forecast results for Canada.

In the fure, we will also provide
1. county, district, state and national level forecast results for winter wheat in the United States in the first half of 2021;
2. department, province and national level forecast results for corn, soybean and wheat in Brazil in the first half of 2021;
3. microregion, state and national level forecast results for corn, soybean and wheat in Argentina in the first half of 2021.

The update time periods of the current national level results are shown as below:

|Country                 | Crop                            | Start Day    | End Day | 
| :---------------------: | :----------: | :----------: | :-----------:
| US | corn | 153 | 305 |
| US | soybean | 153 | 353 | 
| CA | corn | 129 | 209 |
| CA | soybean | 121 | 249 |
| CA | spring wheat | 185 | 249 |

The historical crop yield and production data is available in cmdtystats https://www.barchart.com/cmdty/data/fundamental/explore.

## Data Source and processing
NDVI, NDWI, LST data is generated from MODIS satellite images. MODIS is a global product with 8-day period. The resolution of the original MODIS images is 250m https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_grid.html. For the US and Canada, we use the cropland data layer (CDL) with 30m resolution released by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Government of Canda to find the pixels marked as the target crops. Then we calculate the mean values of weather data for each county or district.

For north america, the tmax, tmin, prcp data is generated from GHCND stations. GHCND stations are located all over the world, but the most of them are distributed in north america regions. For south america, these weather data is calculated from CPC data. CPC is also a global product, which is updated everyday.
