# Overview

## Description

Barchart is the leading provider of global crop production and yield forecasts generated through geospatial data and machine learning models.  Daily forecasts for covered crops are released daily throughout the relevant growing season.

For North America, our weather data is aggregated from from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite products and Global Historical Climatology Network Daily (GHCND) stations.  For South American forecasts, our models use MODIS and Climate Prediction Center (CPC). There are seven parameters that we use to make our foecasts which are:
* Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
* Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)
* Land Surface Temperature (LST) Day / Night
* Maximum and Minimum Temperature
* Precipitation

## Product Roadmap

In the fure, we will also provide
1. county, district, state and national level forecast results for winter wheat in the United States in the first half of 2021;
2. department, province and national level forecast results for corn, soybean and wheat in Brazil in the first half of 2021;
3. microregion, state and national level forecast results for corn, soybean and wheat in Argentina in the first half of 2021.

## Data Source and processing
NDVI, NDWI, LST data is generated from MODIS satellite images. MODIS is a global product with 8-day period. The resolution of the original MODIS images is 250m https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_grid.html. For the US and Canada, we use the cropland data layer (CDL) with 30m resolution released by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Government of Canda to find the pixels marked as the target crops. Then we calculate the mean values of weather data for each county or district.

For north america, the tmax, tmin, prcp data is generated from GHCND stations. GHCND stations are located all over the world, but the most of them are distributed in north america regions. For south america, these weather data is calculated from CPC data. CPC is also a global product, which is updated everyday.
