#### When is national level forecast result released?

The release time is shown as below. For example, the US corn forecast result will be available from the 153rd day of the year, and will be updated daily until the 305th day of the year, which is also our final forecast result. After that, our forecast result will not change.

|Country                 | Crop                            | Start Day    | End Day | 
| :---------------------: | :----------: | :----------: | :-----------:
| US | corn | 153 | 305 |
| US | soybean | 153 | 353 | 
| CA | corn | 129 | 209 |
| CA | soybean | 121 | 249 |
| CA | spring wheat | 185 | 249 |

#### What is Normalized Difference Vegetation Index(NDVI)?
NDVI is the most popular indicator that can be used to assess how vegetation develops with time. NDVI ranges from -1 to 1.\
High NDVI values (approximately 0.6 to 0.9) correspond to dense vegetation such as that found in temperate and tropical forests or crops at their peak growth stage.\
Moderate NDVI values (approximately 0.2 to 0.5) correspond to sparse vegetation such as shrubs and grasslands or senescing crops.\
Areas of barren rock, sand, or snow usually show very low NDVI values (for example, 0.1 or less).

#### How NDVI is calculated?
The NDVI is derived from spectral reflectance measurements in the near-infrared (NIR) region and in the red(visible) region, as follows:\
NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)\
In general, if there is much more reflected radiation in near-infrared wavelengths than in visible wavelengths, then the vegetation in that pixel is likely to be dense.Subsequent work has shown that the NDVI is directly related to the photosynthetic capacity and hence energy absorption of plant canopies

#### What is Normalized Difference Water Index(NDWI)?
The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is a remote sensing derived index estimating the leaf
water content at canopy level. NDWI ranges between -1 to +1, , depending on the leaf water content but also on the vegetation type and cover.
It is therefore a very good proxy for plant water stress.  Its usefulness for drought monitoring and early warning has been demonstrated in different studies.

#### How NDWI is calculated?
The NDWI is derived from spectral reflectance measurements in the near-infrared region and in the short wave infrared (SWIR)  region, as follows:\
NDWI = (NIR - SWIR) / (NIR + SWIR)\
NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content and in spongy mesophyll of vegetation canopies



## Weather Data

#### What sources do we use to generate weather data
NDVI, NDWI, LST data is generated from MODIS satellite images. MODIS is a global product with 8-day period. The resolution of the original MODIS images is 250m https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_grid.html. For north america, the tmax, tmin, prcp data is generated from GHCND stations. GHCND stations are located all over the world, but the most of them are distributed in north america regions. For south america, these weather data is calculated from CPC data. CPC is also a global product, which is updated everyday. 

#### How do we deal with MODIS satellite images?

For the US and Canada, we use the cropland data layer (CDL) with 30m resolution released by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Government of Canda to find the pixels marked as the target crops. Then we project the MODIS images to let it have the same coordinate reference system and resolution. After that, we pick up those target pixels to calculate the mean values of weather data for each county or district.

#### CDL is always released in the next year, how to deal with that?

We do not generate the CDL of current year in this project. We use the CDL image of the previous year to generate our weather data. For example, in year 2020, we use the 2019 official CDL to find the target pixels and calculate weather data.
